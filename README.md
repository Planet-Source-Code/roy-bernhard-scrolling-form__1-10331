## Scrolling Form


</div>

### Description

This code is a template for a scrolling form. This is great to use if you would like to create applications that work in all resolutions.

I reccomend placing this form in your C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Template\Forms

folder so that it is available as a form template.
 
### More Info
 
On the main form there are two picture boxes, and two scrolling controls. The scrolling controls are not initially visible as they get sized during run-time. The most important aspect of this form is the size of the inner picture box, as it represents your 'form'. So basically all you should worry about with this form is to make the form big enough to see the main picture box, and the main picture box big enough to see the inner picture box(the one with the black outline.) Then just add controls to the inner picture box as you would a normal form and viola! The inner picture box is set by default to be horizontally fully viewable in 800x600. Finally, I would suggest removing the border of the inner picture box before final compile so it all looks perfect! Enjoy.
